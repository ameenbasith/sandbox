# Sandbox
This is a sandbox type application carried out as a final project. It includes countless elements, where certain elements are actually impacted by the presence of another said element.

## The Solution
Created numerous different interactions if (something is next to a certain pixel) then (do something else)

## What I Learned
This application allowed me to become better accustomed to Java as I implemented a base class/interface and created sub-classes, which I actually hadn't done at this scale prior to this assignment.
